### DISCLAIMER:
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [**Academic Honesty**](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) policy of the course.
