### Notes:
- All codes in this repository have passed the check50 with a 100% so you don't have to worry about the code being inaccurate.
- You can still check the total score using " check50 " for code accuracy and " style50 " for code styling.

### DISCLAIMER:
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [**Academic Honesty**](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) policy of the course.
